## Open issues, questions, stuff to improve for the future
**Disclaimer:** Just a list of potential tasks (in no particular order) that can serve as basis for future works

- **Improve/re-work the existing chemistry:** new features of MØD are currently not reflected in PKevo, not all substrategies are implemented, add reactions for other PKS domains (MT, SH) -> suitable work for a student with background in chemistry
- **Better identification of actual polyketides:** MØD can create up to 150 molecules for a PKS, which makes the final evaluation using LigandScout very costly. Maybe ML could be used here to identify which SMILES string is a polyketide? -> suitable for student with IT background
- **Deconstruction of molecules into PKS domain-strings:** Was already started by Robert but not implemented in PKevo, however it could be added as new feature for PKevo 2.0 -> not enough for a MA or PHD project itself, but could be part of it
- **Other evalution option than LigandScout:** I see two problems with using LigandScout - for one it's proprietary and you need to buy a license, the second one (might be the bigger problem) is the Pharmacophore Fit score calculated by LigandScout itself. Judging by the test results so far it has a low sensitivity and scores a molecule with either 0.0 or values about 30 (later going as high as 86 in the end of a simulation run). For a better GE simulation it would be critical to get values even slightly above 0.0, so that the GE algorithm would know when it's heading into the right direction. Currently it's left in the dark guessing until it finally generates something that is considered acceptable by LigandScout. There doesn't seem to be a way to refine LigandScout's scoring behaviour via available CLI tools
