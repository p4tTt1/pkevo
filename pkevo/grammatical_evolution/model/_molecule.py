    A simple lass representing chemical molecules by a SMILES string instead of

    GE evalution is stored for the molecule as well. This score can potentially change,
    the SMILES representation should not (hence the leading underscore to indicate this. 
    Python unfortunately doesn't offer a fool-proof way of forbiding individual attributes
