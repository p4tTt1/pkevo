        This servers as a boilerplate template for writing custom fitness functions. The way it works is that you
        write your fitness function as a class (give it an arbitrary, yet meaningful name) inside this module and
        define the classattributes and write your fitness function inside 'objective_function' (the name needs to 
        remain unchanged!). You can of course add additional functions to your class, but the application will only
        ever call the 'objective_function' function.

            This is the heart and brain of the whole class. What you do here is completely up to you. The only condition 
            is that you return a float value (which will be set as the fitness score of the individual) if you're 
            evaluating Individuals separately (when `coevolution` is set to False), otherwise when evaluating whole 
            populations at once, you do not return anything, but instead set the fitness value for each individual 
            directly inside this function (since Individuals are passed as references, those changes will remain 
            even outside the function). You may even choose to cause "side-effects" by editing the Individual further
